>  **Framephobia Name** : As the creator of this theme i love to share how Framephobia came out. I was struggling with the job switch from an Vue powered app to Angular powered app on another compony, while on this process i had times where i need lots of **breaks**, I was surrounded by TypeScript, RxJs, NgRx, Jasmine & Karma vs vs. So i started to colorize my ide time to time and decided to publish it. Framephobia is the anxiety times of mine dealing with framework switch and vice verse. Hope you enfoy with the theme.. BEST ðŸ˜Ž
